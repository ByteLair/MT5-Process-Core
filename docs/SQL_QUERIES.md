## üí° Dicas de Uso

### Via Docker:
```bash
# Executar query via docker exec
docker exec mt5_db psql -U trader -d mt5_trading -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM market_data;"

# Executar query de arquivo
docker exec -i mt5_db psql -U trader -d mt5_trading < query.sql

# Modo interativo
docker exec -it mt5_db psql -U trader -d mt5_trading
```

### Via pgAdmin:
1. Acesse http://localhost:5051
2. Adicione servidor (Host: db, Port: 5432, User: trader, DB: mt5_trading)
3. Cole e execute as queries acima

### Performance:
- Use `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` antes de queries complexas
- Adicione √≠ndices se necess√°rio
- Use `LIMIT` para queries explorat√≥rias
- TimescaleDB otimiza automaticamente queries por timestamp
